# M1.2 – JavaScript Basics

This project contains four beginner-level JavaScript exercises from Introduction to JavaScript.  
The focus is on variables, user input, conditionals, arithmetic, and basic loops.  
All programs use `prompt()` and `parseFloat()` for input where required.

## Exercises

### **1. Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit**
Prompts the user for a Celsius value and converts it to Fahrenheit.  
Then prompts for a Fahrenheit value and converts it to Celsius.  
Outputs are formatted to one decimal place using `.toFixed(1)`.

---

### **2. Largest of Three Numbers**
Prompts the user for three numbers and prints the largest using `if/else` and logical operators.  

> **Note:** This version does not handle ties or missing input.  
> It is intentionally kept simple to match the Module 1 scope.

---

### **3. Odd Numbers (1–50)**
Prints all odd numbers from 1 to 50 using the modulus operator (`%`) inside a loop.  
Each odd number is output on a new line in the console.

### **4. Millionaire Savings (While Loop)**
Starts with a hard-coded balance and doubles it every year until it reaches $1,000,000.  
Tracks and outputs:
- Years to reach $100,000
